# 320 - Shortest Route

Given an unweighted, undirected graph which represents a metro map as follows

* vertices are stations
* edges are the path between two stations


Given a start station and ending station, determine the minimum number of stops that must be made to get to the destination.

```
Input: A Graph (unweighted/undirected), a starting Vertex, and an ending Vertex
Output: Integer
```
# Example
```
Input: The graph represented below, Vertex A, Vertex F
```

```
Output: 2 Stops (From A stop at C, and then stop at F)
```

# Constraints

```
Time Complexity: O(V + E) where V is the number of Vertices and E is the number of Edges
Auxiliary Space Complexity: O(V)
```

A graph `Vertex` instance has the following properties:
* `value` : a string
*	`edges` : a list which contains references to other vertices in the Graph

The graph has a list of all the vertices: `Graph.vertices`

The `Vertex` values are all unique

# Solution

Perform a BFS from the starting node:

* 1) Create a `distance` hashtable.

  * a) Store each vertex value as the key, and a distance of `INFINITY`

  * b) Set the `start` vertex value to `0`

* 2) Create a `visited` hashtable

  * a) Store each vertex value as the key and a visited to false


* 3) Instantiate a queue and place the starting vertex in the queue

* 4) While there is something in the queue

  * a) Dequeue the `current` vertex and mark it as visited.

  * b) For each edge, if the associated `neighbor` has not been visited

    * i) Update the neighborâ€™s `distance` as the minimum of:

      * 1) the distance of `neighbor`

      * 2) the distance of the `current + 1`

    * ii) Add the neighbor to the queue

* 5) Return the distance of `end` vertex
