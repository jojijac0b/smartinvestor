# 000 - Application Diagramming

Walk through an project or application you worked on recently. This could be something you built individually or in a group.

Some things to think about are:

### What was the project at a high level?

* What did it do?
* Who were the (intended or actual) users?
* What was the scope? (codebase size, team size, time invested etc.)
* What were the goals?


### What was the structure of the application?

* What frameworks/technologies were used?
* What were the main features/views/routes?
* How did the frontend/backend/db interact with each other?
  * If this wasn't a full stack application, what were the main data flows, and how can you capture what the app was doing?



### What was your personal involvement in the project?

* What features did you build?
* What were some of the challenges you encountered?
* What did you learn?
* What was the result? (Think STAR format)
* Walk through one route, view, feature in detail
  * What http requests were made to the backend?
  * How did this update the database?
  * How did this impact the project as a whole?
  * Go into detail about this feature you worked on
