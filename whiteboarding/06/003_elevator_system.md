# Objects

a. These are given for you: `Elevator` class, `Button` class.

b.  What other objects do you need if any?

# Interviewer Checklist

1) Does the interviewee clarify the questions to get a good understanding of user requirements?

2) Does the interviewee demonstrate the composition of each object i.e., what owns what?

3) Does the interviewee demonstrate  inheritance hierarchy if applicable?

4) Does the interviewee detail the minimum properties (data) and methods (actions) of these objects to allow the user requirements to be met?

5) Do the objects ensure encapsulation of data leading to a good interface for methods and restricting unnecessary access to data?

# Specific Follow Up Questions

1) Where do you place an elevator that isnâ€™t occupied?

2) How does the system know which elevator to send to a request?

3) How does adding more elevators change the algorithm to determine elevator route?
